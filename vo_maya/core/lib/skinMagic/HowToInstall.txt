1. Unzip all files into same folder

2. Run Maya

3. Run command below in command bar with Python way
    execfile(r'the folder path\skinMagic.py')
    example:
    execfile(r'C:\Users\Chris\Scripts\skinMagic.py')

    keep the 'r' in front of your path to avoid IO Error may cause

Tested under Maya 2011 and above, you may need to install Pymel for Maya 2010 or elder build by yourself

Known Issue:
1.  Error: Syntax error
    Please check if you run the command in Python mode, you can click "mel" word to toggle between mel and python

2.  # Error: ImportError: No module named pymel.core #
    That means you are using old version of MAYA and have no Pymel installed, please download and install Pymel follow this page:
    http://download.autodesk.com/us/maya/2011help/PyMel/install.html

3.  Error: IOError: file <maya console> line 1: 2
    It mean your path has some error when you run the execfile command, please double check what you typed

4.  Maya 2017 and newer version changed Api of UI display cause weight function got issue with it, I'm still looking for the solution on it. At this moment, I'll suggests use with 2016 or older version.
